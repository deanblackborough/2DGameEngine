# Prune2D

Prune2D may one day become a simple 2D game engine.

I'm playing with C++ and figured this way would be a good way to learn the language, additionally, I'm going to use Prune2D to teach my kids how to code.

This project is purely a hobby, I'm mainly going to use it to create games with my kids.

I've included a [premake](https://github.com/premake) script to setup the solution for Visual Studio, I'll work on updating the [premake](https://github.com/premake) script for OSX when I feel like moving the project over to my Mac.
