# 2DGameEngine
Playing with C++ to see if I can create a simple 2D game engine from scratch

I'm not planning on taking over the world with this enging, this project is for learning and so I can start working on little game projects with my kids.

Premake script included, if you use Visual Studio on Windows, run the setup batch file in /scripts. I'll add a setup script for XCode when I transfer the project over to my Mac.
